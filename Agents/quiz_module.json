Now next step you have to initialize a new React project and display a single hardcoded quiz question with its multiple-choice options. Focus on creating the basic component structure for your quiz and rendering the question text and answer buttons using props or direct state."

Implement event handlers for the answer options to store the chosen answer in your component's state when an option is clicked."

After an answer is selected, display immediate visual feedback to the user (e.g., 'Correct!' or 'Incorrect, the answer was X') without advancing to the next question yet."

When all questions have been answered, hide the question interface and display the user's final score. Include a 'Play Again' button to reset the quiz and allow the user to start from the beginning."

Now next step you have to enhance the user interface by applying conditional rendering. For example, change the background color of the selected answer button to green for correct and red for incorrect after submission, and ensure the 'Next Question' button only appears after an answer has been chosen and feedback is shown."
